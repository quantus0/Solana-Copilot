# Solana Copilot

"The ChatGPT for your Solana wallet."

## Overview
Solana Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that enables users to interact with Solana dApps and wallets using natural language. AI-driven autonomous agents with on-chain smart wallets. Users can create agents with natural language goals (e.g., "Optimize gas for trades under 1 SOL"), simulate transactions, and monitor analytics—all powered by Solana.

#Features
- AI Agents as Smart Wallets: Define goals in plain English, executed on-chain via Anchor.
- Gas Optimization: Minimize transaction costs with a built-in optimizer.
- Transaction Simulator: Preview Solana transactions before execution.
- Analytics Dashboard: Track agent performance and wallet activity.
- Polished UI: React + Tailwind CSS front-end, deployed on Netlify.
